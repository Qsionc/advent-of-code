# Advent of code in C++

This branch is created to allow for my C++ implementation of AOC 2021 to be collected in one place.

Each successive commit will add additional folders in source and include with days.

## How it is going

### Day 1

[Code can be seen here](https://github.com/Qsionc/advent-of-code/tree/cpp-2021/source/day_1)

I feel the strongest in C++. I hope code is enjoyable and clean. 
I tried to make it as small as possible, maybe it could be smaller, but I like how it looks right now.
