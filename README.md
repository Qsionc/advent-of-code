# Advent of code in rust

This branch is created to allow for my rust implementation of AOC 2021 to be in on place.

Each successive commit will add additional folders in src/bin folder with days

## How it is going

### Day 1

[Code can be seen here](https://github.com/Qsionc/advent-of-code/blob/rust-2021/src/bin/day1)

After some time spent on learning basics of Rust i got a grip of it and now, my new implementation of AOC 2021 started.
Both parts look decent, but reviews and comments are welcome!
