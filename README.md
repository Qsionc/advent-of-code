# Advent of code in rust

This branch is created to allow for my rust implementation of AOC 2021 to be in on place.

Each successive commit will add additional folders in src/bin folder with days

## How it is going

### Day 1

[Code can be seen here](https://github.com/Qsionc/advent-of-code/blob/rust-2021/src/bin/day1)

After some time spent on learning basics of Rust i got a grip of it and now, my new implementation of AOC 2021 started.
Both parts look decent, but reviews and comments are welcome!

### Day 2

Now that i get a grasp of Rust, i managed to clean day two without any problems. Looks fun. I hope C++ version can be also smooth.

### Day 3

[Code can be seen here](https://github.com/Qsionc/advent-of-code/blob/rust-2021/src/bin/day3)

Now now, this gave me a little problem, with all those slices and stuff i had to do in order to find good solution.
But i managed! This time i learned a little bit about vectors of slices and such ;)
