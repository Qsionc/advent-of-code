# Advent of Code

This is my personal repository for Advent of Code implementations in following languages:

1. `Rust` - this is my hobby language I am in process of learning, maybe in future I will be able to use it more professionally
2. `C++` - This is my main language. I feel most comfortable with this one and plan to make independent implementations of each of existing tasks from AOC

## Structure

Each year I will create new branch, with names starting with language used and ending with year.

## Current branches:

### Year 2021:
1. [`cpp-2021`](https://github.com/Qsionc/advent-of-code/tree/cpp-2021)
2. [`rust-2021`](https://github.com/Qsionc/advent-of-code/tree/rust-2021)
